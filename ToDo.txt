Trigger:
·	change delay array to s!!!
·	get correct values for necessary timing (eg. min duration between Power AMP on & AWG on)
-	maybe add more cases that are very important in the check_and_correct_input.vi 
·	use Burst mode for multiple measurements with one nozzle spray
-	not neccesarly, just triple trigger
·	trigger from labview
-	change trigger speed via LabVIEW
-	turn on only if everything is working
·	add Background scan option (i.e. turn off nozzle but leave everything else switch on)
·	add nozzle purge option (all off but nozzle)

Power Amp:
- active low -> change trigger settings accordingly

OSC:
- scan background with every measurement (before nozzle is activated
