Trigger:
- catch false inputs (start > begining)
	- get correct values for necessary timing (eg. min duration between Power AMP on & AWG on)
- use Burst mode for multiple measurements with one nozzle spray
	- not neccesarly, just triple trigger
- trigger from labview
	- change trigger speed via LabVIEW
	- turn on only if everything is working
- add Background scan option (i.e. turn off nozzle but leave everything else switch on)

Power Amp:
- active low -> change trigger settings accordingly

OSC:
- scan background with every measurement (before nozzle is activated
